# 3,5" Guition JC3248W535 HomeAssistant display

There are many more or less complex designs for this display. However, I wanted a simple screen showing the temperature and humidity of the room it is located in, the outside temperature, the forecast, and the time. I couldn't find anything like that, so I created this design. In addition, I added pages with light switches for a given room and a list of data from several indicators. 

Backlight management has been added to the logic. During the day, the backlight is set to 30%, and at night it automatically switches to 15%. When interaction is detected, it will brighten to 100%. Also, switching pages when there is no interaction will return to the initial state, i.e. to the temperature page.
