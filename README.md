# 3,5" Guition JC3248W535 HomeAssistant display

There are many more or less complex designs for this display. However, I wanted a simple screen showing the temperature and humidity of the room it is located in, the outside temperature, the forecast, and the time. I couldn't find anything like that, so I created this design. In addition, I added pages with light switches for a given room and a list of data from several indicators.
